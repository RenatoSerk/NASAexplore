# NASA Explore

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a web UI for the NASA images API (https://images.nasa.gov/). The app is able to return image results from a search term as well as store liked images which are displayed in their own gallery.  

A working version is hosted at https://obscure-ocean-24434.herokuapp.com/
